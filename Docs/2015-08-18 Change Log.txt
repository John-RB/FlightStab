###################### This is untested experimental code ######################
Added support for dual ailerons when using a hardware modified RX3SM DSMx stabilizer.
Note that the RX3SM DSM2 device is not supported as it does not have enough connectors.

###################### This is untested experimental code ######################
This code is based on the 2015-04-14 release code

I have only done minimal bench testing of this code on a Flip 1.5 using only the
SBUS and SBUS_OUT versions of the firmware.  All the other versions have
been untested.  Do through ground testing if you plan to work with any of
the Hex files in the repository.

The following have been added or changed

Timing of servo output pulses.
------------------------------

OFS emits the servo pulses in a serial order, one after the other.
The default order has always been RUD, ELE, THR, AIL, AUX1, AILR, AUX2, FLAPS
AUX1 is used internally for the Mode/Gain control and is not emitted on some 
versions of the hardware.

On aircraft that use more than one servo per axis (dual ailerons and/or dual 
elevators) it is desirable to have both servos receive updated information at
or near the same time.  In order to accomplish this version changes the servo
output order to AIL, AILR, ELE, FLAPS (2nd elevator), RUD, THR, AUX2, AUX1.

The old output order is still in the code and can be activated with the
@define ORIGINAL_PWM_ORDER.

NOTE that the output order has nothing to do with the received order in the
serial modes.  You set those the say was as before - nothing has changed.

Configuration SERVO_FRAME_RATE
------------------------------

This configuration parameter is used to slow down the servo update to 
allow for the use of analog servos with fast input frame times like S.BUS.
(9ms for Taranis, 11ms for Spektrum with OrangeRX, 14ms for Futaba).

The previous use of this parameter had a special case for the value 0, it
forced the servo out interval to be the same as the input interval if possible.
With the serial output design of OFS, the servo interval can't be faster than
the sum of the pulse widths of all the output channels.  Thus values greater
than 0, did not do anything until the value used is greater than the sum of the
pulse widths for all output channels.  Once equal to or greater than the sum of 
all the pulse widths for all output channels it becomes effective.  If set to 
a value such as 18 then the interval between servo outputs will be forced to
18ms.  It is important to note that in this case the servo outputs will be
asynchronous to the input timing.  This cause the latency between the TX
and the servo pulses to be variable.

The change I have made is to also use values of 1 and 2 as special cases
in addition to 0.  When  the value of 1 is used then every other received
frame will trigger the servo outputs.  When the value is 2 then every
third received frame will trigger the servo outputs.  This forces the
outputs to be synchronous the the TX frame time and keep the latency 
somewhat constant (there will always be minor movement due to interrupt
latencies with the processor being used.

If the value is set to 1 and a Taranis is being used as the TX (which
has a 9ms frame time) then the servo outputs will be at an 18ms
interval and in synchronization with the Taranis received frame.

Stabilized S.BUS output
-----------------------

A request was received to add the ability to receive an S.BUS frame,
add the proper stabilization corrections and then construct an S.BUS
output frame.  To eliminate unwanted interrupts during the processing,
the servo output pulses are eliminated.

The reason for the request was to allow the stabilizer to function with
power distribution board that only function with serial data (like S.BUS)
and decode and send signal and power to the servos.

The hex files with SBUS_OUT in the file name perform this function.

The S.BUS standard does not include frame rates as high as 18ms, thus
only servos that can operate with a 9ms frame time should be used.

The SERVO_FRAME_RATE settings can be used to skip 1 or 2 S.BUS output frames,
but this is outside of the S.BUS specification and may or may not provide the
desired results.


2015-04-14
Force gyro Digital Low Pass Filter to 5HZ (was 256HZ on MPU-6050 gyros)
Add Programming Box configuration option to set Digital low Pass Filter Bandwidth

2015-02-21 FlightStab.ino 
Add use of D12 for AUX2 out with the Flip 1.5 in Serial mode.

Force master_gain to 0 when gain (AUX_IN)is in the range of 1475us - 1575us.
This is to allow master_ gain to have a valued of when when hysteresis is
exited.  Previously, master_ gain went from 0 to 26 at hysteresis area exit.

2015-02-07 FlightStab.ino 
Change made on 2015-02-02 inadvertently moved the hysteresis for zero gain. 
Restore to 1474us to 1525us for zero gain.

2015-02-03 FlightStab.ino 
MIXER_EPA settings were not being properly applied to ELE-R (normally Flap) 
channel. Corrected firmware bug after Mixer was applied for RUD 2-ELE 2-AIL 
mode.

2015-02-02 FlightStab.ino
Add #define RX_WIDTH_MODE_MID 1550
This new value will be used to move gain input hysteresis to reside entirely in 
the Hold Mode Range. This forces Rate Mode for any value below 1525 which 
insures resetting any Hold Mode corrections when gain is set to 0.

2015-01-30
SerialRX.ino
Use #define for mid channel value instead of hard coded 1520

Made changes to FlightStab.h for added MIXER_EPA Mode for 900-2100us
and new wing mode RUD 2-ELE 2-AIL

Made changes to FlightStab.ino to support the new MIXER_EPA Mode and new wing 
mode.  

New wing mode required increasing the size of arrays mix_out_low_limit, 
mix_out_high_limit and zero_correction.  

Size of pout2[] in apply_mixer() also increased to allow tracking of flap 
channel limits as flp_out2 is used for second elevator.  Size of loop applying 
limits is now dynamic to allow flap channel to act as unconstrained pass through 
when not being used for second elevator.

Removed build option for MAX_TRAVEL as new MIXER_EPA eliminates the need.
