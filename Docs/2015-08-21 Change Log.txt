2015-08-21 FlightStab Change Log

2015-08-21
A problem was discovered with the 2015-08-18 release.  An error in subtraction
order resulted in the pitch and roll axis being reversed in Delta mode and
the pitch and yaw axis reversed in V-Tail mode.


2015-08-18
Added 2 new mounting orientations, Rotate 90 degrees Left and Rotate 90 degrees Right.
Fixed Inflight Calibration which was not working properly for Delta and V-Tail modes.
Added code to capture center stick for Flap channel.
Updated Programming Box firmware to support new mounting options.


2015-08-01
Added support for dual ailerons when using a hardware modified RX3SM DSMx stabilizer.
Note that the RX3SM DSM2 device is not supported as it does not have enough connectors.


2015-04-14
Force gyro Digital Low Pass Filter to 5HZ (was 256HZ on MPU-6050 gyros)
Add Programming Box configuration option to set Digital low Pass Filter Bandwidth

2015-02-21 FlightStab.ino 
Add use of D12 for AUX2 out with the Flip 1.5 in Serial mode.

Force master_gain to 0 when gain (AUX_IN)is in the range of 1475us - 1575us.
This is to allow master_ gain to have a valued of when when hysteresis is
exited.  Previously, master_ gain went from 0 to 26 at hysteresis area exit.

2015-02-07 FlightStab.ino 
Change made on 2015-02-02 inadvertenly moved the hysteresis for zero gain. 
Restore to 1474us to 1525us for zero gain.

2015-02-03 FlightStab.ino 
MIXER_EPA settings were not being properly applied to ELE-R (normally Flap) 
channel. Corrected firmware bug after Mixer was applied for RUD 2-ELE 2-AIL 
mode.

2015-02-02 FlightStab.ino
Add #define RX_WIDTH_MODE_MID 1550
This new value will be used to move gain input hysteresis to reside entirelly in 
the Hold Mode Range. This forces Rate Mode for any value below 1525 which 
insures resetting any Hold Mode corrections when gain is set to 0.

2015-01-30
SerialRX.ino
Use #define for mid channel value instead of hard coded 1520

Made changes to FlightStab.h for added MIXER_EPA Mode for 900-2100us
and new wing mode RUD 2-ELE 2-AIL

Made changes to FlightStab.ino to support the new MIXER_EPA Mode and new wing 
mode.  

New wing mode required increasing the size of arrays mix_out_low_limit, 
mix_out_high_limit and zero_correction.  

Size of pout2[] in apply_mixer() also increased to allow tracking of flap 
channel limits as flp_out2 is used for second elevator.  Size of loop applying 
limits is now dyanmic to allow flap channel to act as unconstrained pass through 
when not being used for second elevator.

Removed build option for MAX_TRAVEL as new MIXER_EPA eliminates the need.


20141216
FlightStab.ino and SerialRX.ino
Add support for Multiplex and HoTT SRXL Protocol

FlightStab.ino
Add Flip 1.5 Build that allows 900us to 2100us travel


20140831
SerialRX.ino
Use timer to determine if received serial data is crossing 2 frames
for both SBUS & Spektrum


20140829
SerialRX.ino
Use #defines for SBUS & Spektrum constants instead of hard coded numbers.
Use defines for receive buffer size.
Limit while loop to not exceed receive buffer size.
Check for 0x00 value in byte 25 of sbus frame to validate frame.


20140505
FlightStab.ino
Add missing defined(FLIP_1_5) in Setup function


FlightStab.ino
Fix logic bug in uint8_t i2c_read_reg() function
